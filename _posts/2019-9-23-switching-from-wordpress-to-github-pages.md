I've decided on making the switch to Github Pages from wordpress. Reasons? 

Well one, I'm not extremely confident that I can keep up with Wordpress security. Even with the auto update features in wordpress and the fact that I'm using AWS Lightsail's Bitnami AMI, if feel it may be a bit over kill for my few blog posts a month(if that). Long have past the days of my web dev/design skills.

Secondly, I want to boost my Markdown and github skills. 

Third, it's free. I mean 5 bucks a month for a Lightsail instance is nothing, I can instead use that 5 bucks towards other fun projects(like an upcoming VPN instance I'm looking at making)

Stay tuned...
